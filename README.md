# Kustomize base: Jenkins

Simplistic kustomize base for a bare-bones installation of Jenkins (single replica, no persistent volume).

## Source

The manifests are based on the examples from [Install Jenkins with YAML files](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#install-jenkins-with-yaml-files) on the Jenkins website.
